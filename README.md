### Part 1: Sharing My Work
I am really proud of the work I've put in this semester. I really think I was able to challenge myself to always learn one more thing each week, and that led up to a really cool final project. I shared my work on OpenProcessing and Twitter. I also tagged @danshiffman, so hopefully I'll get a reply!

I should also add that I'm really excited to have my work shown in the AAHVS Final Exhibition over the next two weeks. My whole family will be in Smith Warehouse for the diploma ceramony and I know they'll be proud to see my work up on the wall.

### Part 2: Reflections on the Course
Victoria Szabo suggested I take Critical Code after I had so much success in her Intro to Web Based Multimedia Communication during the fall semester. I can honestly say I feel like a more technologically critial woman ever since taking both Szabo's and Matt's courses. I am much more able to think critically about works and appreciate the true artistic and technical talent that goes into a a digital work of art. I really loved being challenged by Matt to always dig deeper into the meanings of the work I create. Something that will stick with me for a long time is the idea of being able to "defend every pixel." I think that applies to so many aspects of life - being able to defend why you do things and what your beliefs are - and I learned it in Interactive Graphics. Who would have guessed?

That being said, I also feel very technologically accomplished coming out of this class. Like, I know how to code. I'm not the best, but I'm hella better than I was five months ago and that's pretty awesome. Maybe I'll go buy a #girlswhocode laptop sticker. 

I think the part I struggled with the most through the whole semester is understanding the relationships between different parts of a sketch. I mentioned this as a problem near the beginning of the semester and I've gotten a little better, but I still have a lot of work to do. For example, I wish I could understand more clearly how classes and functins work on a more conceptual level. Like, I understand what they do and how to write them,but I wish I could see in my head their relatoship and how they're read by servers and then shown on our screens. I feel like I understand it 100% with HTML and CSS but haven't gotten there yet with p5.js. 

My favorite section of the class must have been the critiques of the work we did. I loved hearing why other people created the sketches they did and for what reasons. More significantly, I liked being able to explore with a small group of peers how digital art can truly represent the positives and/or provide coping mechanisms for the negatives of the world in which we live. It's pretty amazing. 

Thank you, Matt, for an awesome final semester at Duke! Peace.
